#  Loan Approval Prediction App
A machine learning-powered web application that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant and financial details. This app is built with **Streamlit** for an interactive interface and uses a trained model to deliver real-time predictions. 

## Overview

The Loan Approval Prediction App leverages historical loan data to provide insights into whether a loan application is likely to be approved. The app includes advanced feature engineering, such as calculating total income, monthly instalments, and performing logarithmic transformations to handle skewed financial data.

## Features 

- #### Interactive Interface:
  Users can enter their personal and financial details (e.g., gender, marital status, income, loan amount, etc.) through a user-friendly interface.
- #### Real-Time Predictions:  
  The app predicts loan approval status instantly using a trained Logistic Regression model (or your chosen model).
- #### Advanced Data Transformation: 
  Features like Total Income, Monthly Instalment, and Income After Loan are computed on the fly, with logarithmic transformations applied for improved model performance.
- #### Error Handling:
  The app includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and edge cases.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**

- **Streamlit**

- **Scikit-learn**

- **Pandas & NumPy**

- **Joblib (for model serialization)**

## Deployment
This app is also deployed on Streamlit Cloud. You can access the live version here.

## Model Tuning and Performance
The project includes hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the Logistic Regression model. The app is designed to generalize well on unseen data by implementing proper feature engineering and data preprocessing steps. 

## Future Improvements
- Integration of additional models for ensemble predictions.

- Enhanced visualization of feature importance and model insights.

- User authentication and data persistence for repeated predictions.
